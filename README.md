# JavaScript Learning Project on Amazon

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help you learn and practice JavaScript by building small, interactive features that could be used on an e-commerce site like Amazon. You'll work on fundamental JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and API integration.

## Features

- **Product Carousel:** A dynamic image carousel that displays different product images.
- **Shopping Cart:** A simple shopping cart where users can add, remove, and view products.
- **Search Functionality:** A basic search bar to filter and find products by name.
- **API Integration:** Fetch product data from a mock API and display it on the site.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Text Editor**: Install a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Web Browser**: Use a modern web browser like [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
- **Git** (optional): For version control.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (optional):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-js-project.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd amazon-js-project
   ```
3. **Open the project**:
   - If you cloned the repository, open the folder in your text editor.
   - Otherwise, create a new project folder and start building from scratch.

### Running the Project

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser**: Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your web browser. This will display your webpage.
2. **Start coding**: Begin writing JavaScript in the `script.js` file to add interactivity to your web pages.

## Project Structure

```bash
amazon-js-project/
│
├── amazon.html        # The main HTML file
├── styles       # The main CSS file
└── scripts        # JavaScript file for adding interactivity
└── backend       # mock data
```

### Explanation of Files:

- **index.html**: This file contains the structure of your webpage.
- **styles.css**: Use this file to style your webpage elements.
- **script.js**: This is where you'll write your JavaScript code to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and integrate with APIs.
